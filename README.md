# PetPalace
PetPalace is a full-stack application developed to cater to various needs related to pets, such as buying pets, purchasing pet supplies, and accessing veterinary services. The platform allows users, especially buyers, to interact with sellers, browse and purchase pets and supplies, and even avail veterinary services. The system also includes a robust login and registration functionality powered by .NET and ReactJS on the front end.

The project architecture follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, with Spring Boot and MySQL handling the back-end operations, while ReactJS takes care of the front-end UI components. The application ensures smooth user experiences by integrating well-designed REST APIs for handling requests.
